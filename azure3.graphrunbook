.SYNOPSIS 
    This sample automation runbook onboards Azure VMs for Azure Automation Hybrid Worker.
    It can create a Azure VM or could use an exisiting VM to onboard as a Hybrid Worker.
    Since onboarding a VM to Automation Hybrid Worker requires a Log Analytics workspace, this script also gives the feasibility to the users to provide an already exisiting Log Analytics workspace or the script could also create one for the users.
    This Runbook needs to be run from the Automation account that you wish to connect the VM to.
    
    This script must be executed on a Run As Enabled Automation Account only.   
    This would require the following modules to be present in the Automation account :  
    Az.Accounts, Az.Resources, Az.Automation, Az.OperationalInsights, Az.Compute

.PARAMETER AccountName
    Required. The name of the autmation account in which the script is executed.
 
.PARAMETER CreateLA 
    Required. True, creates a new LA Workspace with the given WorkspaceName in the given LALocation. False, Uses the given WorkspaceName for Hybrid worker registration.
 
.PARAMETER LAlocation
    Optional. The location in which the LA Workspace to be used is present in or the location in which a new LA workspace has to be created in. 
    If not provided the value will be used from the Location parameter.
 
.PARAMETER WorkspaceName
    Optional. The name of the LA workspace to be created or to be used for Hybrid worker registration.
 
.PARAMETER CreateVM 
    Required. True, creates a new VM with the given VMName in the given VMLocation. False, Uses the given VMName for Hybrid worker registration.

.PARAMETER VMName
    Optional. The name of the VM to be created or to be used to onboard as a Hybrid Worker.

.PARAMETER VMImage
    Optional. The name of the VM Image to be created.

.PARAMETER VMlocation
    Optional. The location in which the VM to be used is present in or the location in which a new VM has to be created in. 
    If not provided the value will be used from the Location parameter.

.PARAMETER RegisterHW
    Required. True, Registers the provided VM as a Hybrid Worker. False, Doesn't register the VM as a Hybrdid Worker.
